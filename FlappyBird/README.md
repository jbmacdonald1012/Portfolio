# Overview

This game is a Flappy Bird game based off the popular phone game, Flappy Bird.

Users will attempt to navigate their bird between the pipes to score points. 

If the user hits a pipe, or their bird falls to the ground, the game is over, and the user has the opportunity to restart the game from their keyboard.
