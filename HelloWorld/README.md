# HelloWorld
Hello World Project

As a software engineer I look forward to the opportunity to broaden my spectrum of programming knowledge, as well as improve my ability to creatively solve problems that are presented to me. 

This is a simple Hello World program asks the user if they want to display a message. 
If they type 'y' then the text *Hello World*  is displayed on the console for the user.
If they type 'n' the program states that it is exiting, and exits gracefully.

This program is to demonstrate how a programmer can write code and have a phrase appear on the screen.
